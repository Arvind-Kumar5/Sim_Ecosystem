# Sim_Ecosystem

This codebase for a personal simulated ecosystem project. I am currently working on creating a visual experience of Charles Darwin's theory on evolution by creating different species with intermitent mutations to see how each mutation allows a particular species to survive in an ecosystem. Currently using pygame as a GUI.

TODO:
- Over time, decrease a species life so they eventually die from old age
  - Decrease hunger bar for species as well over time so every animal needs to eat in order to stay alive
- Create "food" pellets for species that is generated every X amount of time
- Allow species to "eat" food pellets and regenerate hunger
